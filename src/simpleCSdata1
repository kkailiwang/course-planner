Days: Friday
starttime: 1:30:00 PM
endtime: 4:20:00 PM
reqs: WAY-CE
Description: Playback combines elements of theater, community work and storytelling. In a playback show, a group of actors and musicians create an improvised performance based on the audience's personal stories. A playback show brings about a powerful listening and sharing experience. During the course, we will tell, listen, play together, and train in playback techniques. We will write diaries to process our experience in the context of education and research.  The course is aimed to strengthen listening abilities, creativity and the collaborative spirit, all integral parts of doing great science. In playback, as in research, we are always moving together, from the known, to the unknown, and back. There is limited enrollment for this class. Application is required.

Description: For graduate students who are TA-ing an AI course. This course prepares new AI section leaders to teach, write, and evaluate AI content. In class, you will be evaluating final projects individually and as a group. You will have discussions criticizing papers and assigning grades to them. You will analyze and solve discussion session problems on the board, explain algorithmsnlike backpropagation, and learn how to give constructive feedback to students. The class will also include a guest speaker who will give teaching advice and talk about AI. Focus is on teaching skills, techniques, and final projects grading. The class meets once a week for the first 6 weeks of the quarter.

Days: Tuesday Thursday
starttime: 3:00:00 PM
endtime: 4:20:00 PM
reqs: WAY-FR GER:DB-EngrAppSci
Description: Introduces the essential ideas of computing: data representation, algorithms, programming &quot;code&quot;, computer hardware, networking, security, and social issues. Students learn how computers work and what they can do through hands-on exercises. In particular, students will see the capabilities and weaknesses of computer systems so they are not mysterious or intimidating. Course features many small programming exercises, although no prior programming experience is assumed or required. CS101 is not a complete programming course such as CS106A. CS101 is effectively an alternative to CS105. A laptop computer is recommended for the in-class exercises.

course: CS102: Big Data - Tools and Techniques
units: 4
component: LEC
Days: Tuesday Thursday
starttime: 1:30:00 PM
endtime: 2:50:00 PM
reqs: WAY-AQR
Description: Aimed at non-CS undergraduate and graduate students who want to learn the basics of big data tools and techniques and apply that knowledge in their areas of study. Many of the world's biggest discoveries and decisions in science, technology, business, medicine, politics, and society as a whole, are now being made on the basis of collecting and analyzing large volumes of data. At the same time, it is surprisingly easy to make errors or come to false conclusions from data analysis alone. This course provides a broad and practical introduction to big data: data analysis techniques including databases, data mining, and machine learning; data analysis tools including spreadsheets, relational databases and SQL, Python, and R; data visualization techniques and tools; pitfalls in data collection and analysis. Tools and techniques are hands-on but at a cursory level, providing a basis for future exploration and application. Prerequisites: comfort with basic logic and mathematical concepts, along with high school AP computer science, CS106A, or other equivalent programming experience.

reqs: WAY-FR GER:DB-Math
Description: What are the theoretical limits of computing power? What problems can be solved with computers? Which ones cannot? And how can we reason about the answers to these questions with mathematical certainty? This course explores the answers to these questions and serves as an introduction to discrete mathematics, computability theory, and complexity theory. At the completion of the course, students will feel comfortable writing mathematical proofs, reasoning about discrete structures, reading and writing statements in first-order logic, and working with mathematical models of computing devices. Throughout the course, students will gain exposure to some of the most exciting mathematical and philosophical ideas of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Specific topics covered include formal mathematical proofwriting, propositional and first-order logic, set theory, binary relations, functions (injections, surjections, and bijections), cardinality, basic graph theory, the pigeonhole principle, mathematical induction, finite automata, regular expressions, the Myhill-Nerode theorem, context-free grammars, Turing machines, decidable and recognizable languages, self-reference and undecidability, verifiers, and the P versus NP question. Students with significant proofwriting experience are encouraged to instead take CS154. Students interested in extra practice and support with the course are encouraged to concurrently enroll in CS103A. Prerequisite: CS106B or equivalent. CS106B may be taken concurrently with CS103.

Description: Introduction to the engineering of computer applications emphasizing modern software engineering principles: object-oriented design, decomposition, encapsulation, abstraction, and testing. Uses the JavaScript programming language. Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of the JavaScript language. No prior programming experience required. This course covers most of the same material as CS106A Section 1 in Java and CS 106A Section 3 in Python, but this course uses the JavaScript programming language. To enroll in this class, enroll in CS 106A Section 2 for Fall Qtr. May be taken for 3 units by grad students. Satisfies WAY-FR requirement.

Speakers from the profession will provide relevant context during a weekly seminar. Weekly assignments include in-depth materials and require students to independently create small video games. Classroom meetings will be used to foster student project discussions, and deepen understanding of material. The course culminates with students forming project teams to create a final video game. Assignments will be completed within the Unity game development engine; prior Unity experience is not required. Given class size limitations, an online survey will be distributed before class starts and students will be selected so to achieve a diverse class composition. Prerequisite: CS 106A or equivalent programming experience.
